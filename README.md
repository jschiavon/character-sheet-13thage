## Usage

Once installed, simply open the app by looking for `13th Age character sheet` in the app launcher. You will be presented with the main page of the app, with a pregenerated character that you can modify as you prefer.

## Features

At the moment some relevant features are still missing, I will update this readme with each following release. 

The available features are:

- Customize your character main details (race and class) and aspects (a variations on the background system for skills that takes from [Fate](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/types-aspects).
- Set your ability score using the standard point buy system.
- The app will automatically compute all your combat statistics such as Armor Class, the Defenses or the Initiative score.
- Roll the dice by tapping on the relevant ability or statistic.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute (I don't know why, as this is mostly a pet project) you can of course submit a pull request or open an issue. The project is built with Flutter, and to build it you would simply need to run `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`.
